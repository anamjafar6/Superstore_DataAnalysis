## **Project Description**  
This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and modeling a simulated superstore dataset to extract meaningful insights and build a
machine learning model to predict total sales. The analysis explores sales trends, customer behaviors,
and factors influencing sales performance.

---

## **Objectives**  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.  
- Build and evaluate a regression model to predict total sales.  
- Create visualizations and insights for business decision-making.  
- Share findings and project files in a professional format.  

---

## **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  

---

## **Dataset**  
- **Name:** Raw Superstore Dataset  
- **Size:** 1,000,000 rows, 20 columns  
- **Description:** Includes data on transactions, product categories, customers, and sales.  
- **Source:** Simulated dataset for educational purposes.

## **Project Workflow**  
### 1. **Data Cleaning**  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- Ensure proper formatting and data types.  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyze sales trends by region, category, and store type.  
- Visualize data with plots and charts to uncover patterns.  

### 3. **Feature Engineering**  
- Create calculated features like `Total_Sales` and encode categorical data.  

### 4. **Modeling**  
- Train a regression model to predict `Total_Sales`.  
- Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE.  

### 5. **Insights and Recommendations**  
- Share actionable insights for business decision-making.  

---

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- Visualizations showing sales trends and key performance metrics.  
- A machine learning model capable of predicting total sales.  
- A well-documented repository for professional showcasing.
