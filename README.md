## Project Description  
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and modeling a simulated superstore dataset to extract meaningful insights and build a machine learning model for predicting total sales. The analysis highlights sales trends, customer behaviors, and factors influencing sales performance.



## Objectives  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns  
- Build and evaluate a regression model to predict total sales  
- Create visualizations to support business decision-making  
- Document and present findings in a professional format  



## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  


## Dataset  
- **Name:** Raw Superstore Dataset  
- **Size:** 1,000,000 rows, 20 columns  
- **Description:** Contains transaction details, product categories, customer data, and sales records  
- **Source:** Simulated dataset for educational purposes  



## Project Workflow  
### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
- Standardized formatting and ensured correct data types  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed sales trends across regions, categories, and store types  
- Created visualizations to reveal hidden patterns and insights  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Generated calculated features such as `Total_Sales`  
- Encoded categorical variables for modeling  

### 4. Modeling  
- Trained a regression model to predict `Total_Sales`  
- Evaluated model performance using MSE and RÂ² metrics  



## Expected Outcomes  
- Visualizations showing sales trends and performance metrics  
- A regression model capable of predicting total sales  
- A structured and professional repository for portfolio use  



## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anamjafar6/superstore-analysis.git
   cd superstore-analysis
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the notebook step by step to reproduce the analysis and model



## Key Insights

* Discounts slightly increase sales volumes but reduce unit prices
* Beverages and Electronics are the top revenue-generating categories
* The North region contributes the most to overall sales
